# Call Back Customers<a name="call-back"></a>

You can create contact flows that provide the ability for customers to leave their phone number and get a call back\. For an example contact flow, see the Sample queued callback template\. 

When a customer leaves their number it's put in a queue and then routed to the next available agent\.

**To see the number of customers waiting for call backs**

1. Go to **Metrics and quality**, **Real\-time metrics**, **Queues**\.

1. By default, customers who are waiting for a call back are counted in the **In queue** column, which counts all customers who are in a queue for an agent\.

To only see a count of the customers waiting for a call back, you need to create a queue that only takes callback contacts\. To learn how to do this, see [Create Amazon Connect Queues](connect-queues.md)\.
