# Configure Agent Settings<a name="configure-agents"></a>

Before you configure your agent settings, here is some info to have on hand\. Of course, you can always change this information later\. 
+ What is their routing profile? They can only be assigned one\. 
+ Will they have the **Agent** security profile or a custom profile you created? 
+ Are they going to use a soft phone? If so, will they be connected to contacts automatically, or will they need to press the **Accept** button in their contact control panel \(CCP\)?
+ Or, are they going to use a desk phone? If so, what is their number?
+  How long do they have for After call work \(ACW\)?
+ Are they going to be assigned to an agent hierarchy?

**Note**  
You can't configure how long an available agent has to connect with a contact before it's missed\. 

**To configure agent settings**

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Users, User management**\.

1. Choose the user you want to configure, then choose **Edit**\.

1. Assign a routing profile to them\. You can only assign one\.

1. Assign the **Agent** security profile, unless you've created custom security profiles\.

1. Under **Phone Type** choose whether the agent is using a desk phone or soft phone\. 
   + If you select desk phone, enter their phone number\.
   + If you select soft phone, choose **Auto\-Accept Call** if you want them to be connected to contacts automatically\. 

1. In **After call work \(ACW\) timeout**, type how long in seconds agents have for after call work\. At the end of this time, it's expected the agent will be finished with ACW for the contact, and will be eligible for inbound contacts again\.

1. Under **Agent Hierarchy** select any groups the agent should be part of\.
