Prompts are audio files played in call flows\. For example, hold music is a prompt\. Amazon Connect comes with a set of prompts that you can add to your contact flows\. Or, you can add your own recordings\. 

Only 8 KHz \.wav files that are less than 50 MB are supported for prompts\. You can upload a pre\-recorded \.wav file to use for your prompt, or record one in the web application\. 

We recommend that you align your prompts and routing policies with each other to ensure a smooth call flow for customers\.
