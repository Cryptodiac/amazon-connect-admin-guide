# Change a Default Contact Flow<a name="change-default-contact-flow"></a>

You can override the way the default flows work by editing them directly, but we don't recommend doing that\. Instead, make a copy of the default flow, assign a name that indicates it's a custom version, and then edit that one\. 

**To change a default contact flow**

1. On the navigation menu, choose **Routing**, **Contact flows**\.

1. Choose the default contact flow you want to customize\.

1. In the upper right corner of the page, choose the **Save** drop\-down arrow\. Choose **Save as**\.

1. Add the contact flow to your custom contact flow experience so it's run instead of the default\.
