# Sample Contact Flows<a name="contact-flow-samples"></a>

Amazon Connect includes a set of sample contact flows that show you how to perform common functions\. They are designed to help you learn how to create your own contact flows that work in a similar way\. For example, if you want to add a queued callback flow to your call center, take a look at the [Sample Queued Callback](sample-queued-callback.md) flow\.

**To explore how the sample flows work**

1. Claim a number if you haven't already: go to **Routing**, **Phone numbers**, **Claim a number**\.

1. Choose the **DID** tab, then choose a number\.

1. In **Contact flow / IVR** use the drop down to choose the sample contact flow you want to try\. Click **Save**\.

1. Call the number\. The sample contact flow that you selected starts\. 

   We recommend opening the sample contact flow in the contact flow designer and following along to see how it works while you're experiencing it\.
