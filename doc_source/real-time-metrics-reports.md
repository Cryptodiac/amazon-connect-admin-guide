# Real\-time Metrics Reports<a name="real-time-metrics-reports"></a>

Real\-time metrics reports show real\-time or near\-real time metrics information about activity in your contact center\. Metrics such as **Online** show the number of agents currently online in real\-time, updating every 15 seconds\. Metrics such as **Handled** and **Abandoned** reflect near real\-time values for your contact center\.

You can customize the reports, specify a time range for each report, select metrics for each report, and select filters for data to include or exclude from each report\.

Data in real\-time metrics reports is refreshed as follows:
+ The **Real\-time metrics** page refreshes every 15 seconds\.
+ Metrics such as **Active** and **Availability** refresh as activity occurs, with a small system delay for processing the activity\.
+ Agent near real\-time metrics, such as **Missed** and **Occupancy**, refresh every 5 minutes\.
+ Contact near real\-time metrics refresh about a minute after a contact ends\.
