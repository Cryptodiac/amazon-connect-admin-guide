# Using the CCP \(the Agent UI\)<a name="agent-user-guide"></a>

Agents use the Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) to interact with customer contacts\. It's how they receive calls, chat with contacts, transfer them to other agents, put them on hold, and perform other key tasks\.

Large businesses often choose to customize their CCP\. For example, they might want to integrate it with a CRM\. However, this section describes how CCP works before it is customized\.

We recently released an updated CCP\. It provides a single interface for agents to manage both voice and chat contacts\. Even if your business is currently taking only voice contacts, we recommend using the updated CCP\.

The following image shows the CCP\.
