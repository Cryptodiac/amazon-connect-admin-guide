# Set Up Phone Numbers for Your Contact Centers<a name="contact-center-phone-number"></a>

After you create an Amazon Connect instance, you can claim a phone number to use for your contact center\. After you claim a number, you can place a test call in to your contact center to confirm that it is working correctly\. If you want to keep a phone number you already have, you can port the phone number and use it with Amazon Connect\.

Agents handle calls using the Contact Control Panel \(CCP\)\. For more information, see [Communicate With Contacts](amazon-connect-contact-control-panel.md)\.
