# Set Up Phone Numbers for Your Contact Center<a name="contact-center-phone-number"></a>

After you create an Amazon Connect instance, you can claim a phone number to use for your contact center\. You can use this phone number to place a test call in to your contact center to confirm that it is working correctly\. You can also use it in your production environment\.

For pricing information about how much a claimed phone number costs, see [Amazon Connect pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing/)\.

If you want to keep a phone number you already have, you can port the phone number and use it with Amazon Connect\.
