# Integrate With Your CRM<a name="crm"></a>

You can integrate Amazon Connect with the Salesforce and Zendesk CRMs\. Integration allows you to launch your contact center in your CRM of choice, maintain your existing user base, and use the Amazon Connect cloud\-based infrastructure\.

To integrate the Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) into your CRM, see [Amazon Connect Contact Streams](https://github.com/aws/amazon-connect-streams)\. When completed, add the origin URLs to your instance settings\. This enables communication between Amazon Connect and your CRM\. For more information, see [Use an Allow List for Integrated Applications](app-integration.md)\.
