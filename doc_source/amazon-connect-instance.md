## Data Storage<a name="datastorage"></a>

Data, such as call recordings and reports, is stored securely in an Amazon S3 bucket\. During setup, a default Amazon S3 bucket is created and encrypted using AWS Key Management Service\. This bucket and key are used for both calling recordings and reports\. Alternatively, you can use separate buckets and keys for call recordings and reports\.

Before updating the data storage settings, ensure that you are familiar with Amazon S3 and AWS KMS\.

**To update data storage settings**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. Choose the name of the instance from **Instance Alias**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Data storage**\.

1. To update the settings for call recordings, do the following:

   1. For **Call recordings**, choose **Edit**\.

   1. \(Optional\) To disable call recordings, clear **Enable call recording**\.

   1. \(Optional\) If call recordings are enabled, you can create a new S3 bucket or select an S3 bucket that you've already created\.

   1. \(Optional\) If call recordings are enabled, you can update the encryption settings as needed\. To disable encryption, clear **Enable encryption**\. To update the KMS key, specify a key from the same region as your S3 bucket\.

   1. To save your changes, choose **Save**\.

1. To update the settings for exported reports, do the following:

   1. For **Exported reports**, choose **Edit**\.

   1. \(Optional\) To disable exported reports, clear **Enable exported reports**\.

   1. \(Optional\) If exported reports are enabled, you can create a new S3 bucket or select an S3 bucket that you've already created\.

   1. \(Optional\) If exported reports are enabled, you can update the encryption settings as needed\. To disable encryption, clear **Enable encryption**\. To update the KMS key, specify a key from the same region as your S3 bucket\.

   1. To save your changes, choose **Save**\.

## Data Streaming<a name="dataexporting"></a>

You can export contact trace records \(CTRs\) from Amazon Connect and perform real\-time analysis on contacts\. Data streaming uses the Amazon Kinesis platform to support data streaming\.

**To set up data streaming**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. Choose the name of the instance from **Instance Alias**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Data streaming**\.

1. Choose **Enable data streaming**

1. Select an existing resource from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, or choose **Create a new Kinesis Data Firehose**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## Application Integration<a name="app-integration"></a>

All domains that embed the CCP for a particular instance must be explicitly whitelisted for cross\-domain access to the instance\. For example, to integrate with Salesforce, you must whitelist your Salesforce Visualforce domain\.

**To whitelist a domain URL**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. Choose the name of the instance from **Instance Alias**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Application integration**\.

1. Choose **Add origin**\.

1. Type the URL and choose **Add**\.

## Contact Flows<a name="contact-flows"></a>

A contact flow defines the customer experience with the contact center from start to end\. You can configure your contact flow using the AWS Management Console as follows\.

### Security Keys<a name="contact-flow-keys"></a>

Amazon Connect can encrypt sensitive data collected by contact flows using public\-key cryptography\. Provide an X\.509 certificate within your contact flow to encrypt data captured using the stored customer input system attribute\. You must upload a signing key in `.pem` format in order to use this feature\. The signing key is used to verify the signature of the certificate used within the contact flow\.

**Note**  
You can have up to two signing keys active at one time to facilitate rotation\.

Data that is encrypted within a contact flow is made available through the stored customer input system attribute\. The AWS Encryption SDK can be used to decrypt this data within your system\. For more information, see the [AWS Encryption SDK Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/)\.

**To add a security key**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. Choose the name of the instance from **Instance Alias**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Contact flows**\.

1. Choose **Add key**\.

1. Paste the contents of your public key in **Public key contents** and choose **Add**\.

### Amazon Lex<a name="amazon-lex"></a>

With Amazon Lex, you can build conversational interactions \(bots\) that feel natural to your customers, giving you access to the same speech recognition and natural language understanding technology that powers Alexa\. After you create a Lex bot, you can integrate it into your contact flows\.

**To integrate an Lex bot**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. Choose the name of the instance from **Instance Alias**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Contact flows**\.

1. Choose **Add Lex Bot**\.

1. Choose your Lex bot from **Lex bots** and choose **Save Lex Bots**\.

### Contact flow logs<a name="enable-contact-flow-logs"></a>

Select the **Enable Contact flow logs** check box to start sending your contact flow logs to Amazon CloudWatch\. To learn more about Contact flow logs, see [Contact flow logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/userguide/contactflow.html#contact-flow-logs)\.
