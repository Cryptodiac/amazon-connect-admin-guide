# Default Agent Transfer: "Transferring now"<a name="default-agent-transfer"></a>

This default transfer flow is the what the agent experiences when transferring a contact to another agent by using [Create Quick Connects](quick-connects.md)\. A **Play prompt** plays the message “Transferring now\.” Then the **Transfer to agent** block is used to transfer the contact to the agent\. 

**Tip**  
The **Transfer to Agent** block is a beta feature and only works for voice interactions\. To transfer a chat contact to another agent, follow these instructions: [Use Contact Attributes to Route Contacts to a Specific Agent](transfer-to-agent.md#use-attribs-agent-queue)\.

For instructions about how to override and change a default contact flow, see [Change a Default Contact Flow](change-default-contact-flow.md)\.
