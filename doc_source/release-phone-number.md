# Release a Phone Number<a name="release-phone-number"></a>

If you want a different phone number or just have extra you aren't using, you can release them back to inventory\. 

You cannot claim the same phone number after releasing it\.

**To release a phone number**

1. Log in to your contact center using your access URL \(https://*domain*\.awsapps\.com/connect/login\)\.

1. Choose **Routing**, **Phone numbers**\.

1. Choose the phone number you want to release, and then choose **Release**\.

If the phone number is associated with a contact flow, that flow will be deactivated until another number is associated with it\.

When customers call the phone number you've released, they'll get a message that it's not a working phone number\.
